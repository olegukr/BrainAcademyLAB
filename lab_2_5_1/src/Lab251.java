/**
 * Create class MyInitTest with two initialization blocks,
 * two static initialization blocks and two constructors (one constructor()
 * must invoke second constructor(int)). On each block write code
 * that prints on console type of block and block number.
 * For example:
 * “static initialization block 1”
 * “static initialization block 2”
 * “non-static initialization block 1”
 * “non-static initialization block 2”
 * “constructor 1” “constructor 2”
 *
 * Create class Main, which will create instance of class MyInitTest by invoking first constructor.
